game state: out of time

remainder of levels
points rising from enemies
swimming mario

coin blocks move when hit
secret bricks with pickups
multi-coin block
50 pts per broken brick
smashing bricks kills enemies on top of them
smashing bricks collects coins on top of them
extra points for chain reactions
stop shells when stomping on them
shells don't kill enemies offscreen, but can richochet
fireworks for extra points
extra points for finish flag height
random movement
rework level load logic, so transform game state sits on top of level state



bugs:

mario's transform can sometimes get him stuck
something funny happens with input when mario transforms
spawn points don't work properly
