game state: out of time

koopa, flying


remainder of levels
fire mario
fire flower
points rising from enemies
swimming mario
piranha plant
fire chain
coin blocks move when hit
secret bricks with pickups
multi-coin block
platforms
50 pts per broken brick
smashing bricks kills enemies on top of them
extra points for chain reactions
stop shells when stomping on them
shells don't kill enemies offscreen, but can richochet
fireworks for extra points
extra points for finish flag height
patrol movement
movement that doesn't suicide off cliffs
random movement
star movement
rework level load logic, so transform game state sits on top of level state


bugs:
time doesn't reset between levels
mario's transform can sometimes get him stuck
something funny happens with input when mario transforms
